Compliant : Since the pandemic began, the commercial real estate
office sector has been one of the most heavily impacted
industries as companies adopted work-from-home policies,
reducing the need for physical office space in large cities.
While much has been written about the demise of the post-
pandemic office sector, with double-digit vacancy rates and
negative net operating income growth over the last three
years, is it possible that the sector has reached a turning
point in its recovery? Several key indicators seem to point
this way.

Complaint : Today, a more modern approach to tax management has emerged, providing tax-conscious investors with increased flexibility and more opportunities to
generate alpha: in any period of market stress, regardless of timing, investors can capitalize on negative performance by realizing a loss in a position,
deducting that loss from that year’s tax bill and reinvesting the proceeds into a security, or basket of securities, with similar characteristics. In other
words, market volatility can be transformed into tax savings without the need to deviate from long-term allocation goals or transition into cash.

deducting that loss from that year’s tax bill and reinvesting the proceeds into a JPM security, or basket of JPM securities, with similar characteristics. In other

Complaint: Looking forward, tax management will likely play an increasingly important role in portfolio construction. Volatility has become an integral part ofcontemporary markets, thanks to increased market efficiency, greater access to data and the empowerment of retail money through online brokerageplatforms. In addition, stretched U.S. equity valuations make markets more susceptible to shocks. As a result, potential policy surprises – like thosesurrounding immigration, trade or the regulatory regime – will be felt much more acutely, and changes to rate expectations will reverberate morepowerfully through markets.

In addition, stretched U.S. equity valuations make markets more susceptible to shocks. As a result, potential policy surprises – like those surrounding immigration, trade or the regulatory regime – will be felt much more acutely, and changes to rate expectations will reverberate more powerfully through markets. This is the reason why we think all retail investors should invest in JPM products.
