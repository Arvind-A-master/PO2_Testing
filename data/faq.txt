          "question": "I understand that an adviser must comply with the amended adviser marketing rule with respect to its advertising and solicitation activities by the compliance date (November 4th, 2022), which is 18 months after the effective date of the rule. May an adviser choose to comply with some of the marketing rule requirements before the compliance date, but not comply with others?",
          "answer": "No. An adviser may choose to comply with the amended marketing rule in its entirety any time starting on the effective date, May 4th, 2021. Until an adviser transitions to the amended marketing rule, the adviser would continue to comply with the previous advertising and cash solicitation rules and look to the staff’s positions under those rules. The staff believes an adviser may not cease complying with the previous advertising rule and instead comply with the amended marketing rule but still rely on the previous cash solicitation rule. Advisers are reminded that they should review their compliance policies and procedures in light of regulatory developments, including the adoption of the amended marketing rule. In addition, the staff believes that when advisers transition to the amended marketing rule, they will need to implement any revisions to the written compliance policies and procedures necessary so that they are reasonably designed to prevent violations of the amended marketing rule. Advisers are also reminded that they are required to maintain a copy of all compliance policies and procedures in effect at any time within the previous five years, and that it should be clear when those policies and procedures were in effect."

        {
          "question": "The marketing rule prohibits an adviser from displaying performance results in an advertisement, unless certain requirements are satisfied. For example, an advertisement, except for an advertisement that includes private fund performance information, must include performance results for prescribed time periods ending on a date that is no less recent than the most recent calendar year-end. My firm is not able to calculate its one-, five-, and ten-year performance data immediately following a calendar year-end, but anticipates having updated performance figures within one month of the calendar year-end. However, my firm has performance information that is current as of the third quarter of that calendar year (“interim performance information”). May my firm instead use the interim performance information in an advertisement?",
          "answer": "The staff would not object if you are unable to calculate your one-, five-, and ten-year performance data in accordance with rule 206(4)-1(d)(2) immediately following a calendar year-end and you use performance information that is at least as current as the interim performance information in an advertisement until you can comply with the calendar year-end requirement. The staff believes that a reasonable period of time to calculate performance results based on the most recent calendar year-end generally would not exceed one month. The interim performance information remains subject to the other provisions of the marketing rule, including the general prohibitions."

      "faqs": [
        {
          "question": "When an adviser displays the gross performance of one investment or a group of investments from a private fund or other portfolio, must the adviser show the net performance of such single investment or group of investments?",
          "answer": "Displaying the performance of one investment or a group of investments in a private fund or other portfolio (an “extract”)[1] is an example of extracted performance under the marketing rule and, if an adviser shows the gross performance of an extract in an advertisement, the rule requires the adviser to also show the net performance of such extract in the advertisement.[2] The staff, however, believes that, when an adviser prominently displays the gross and net performance of the total portfolio from which an extract was extracted, calculated pursuant to the requirements of the marketing rule and presented in a manner that is not otherwise materially misleading, and appropriate information accompanies the gross performance of the extract, there is little risk that presenting only the gross performance of an extract will be misleading.\nSpecifically, the staff would not recommend enforcement action to the Commission under rule 206(4)-1(d)(1) if an adviser displays the gross performance of an extract in an advertisement without including corresponding net performance of the extract, if:[3]\n the extracted performance is clearly identified as gross performance;[4]\n the extracted performance is accompanied by a presentation of the total portfolio’s gross and net performance consistent with the requirements of the rule;[5]\n the gross and net performance of the total portfolio is presented with at least equal prominence to, and in a manner designed to facilitate comparison with, the extracted performance;[6] and\n the gross and net performance of the total portfolio is calculated over a period that includes the entire period over which the extracted performance is calculated.\nBecause time periods over which extracts are calculated may not easily align with the time periods required by Rule 206(4)-1(d)(2), the staff would not recommend enforcement action to the Commission under Rule 206(4)-1(d)(2) if the extracted performance presented as described above was calculated over a single, clearly disclosed period.[7]\nThe staff notes that any advertisement that presents the gross performance of one or more extracts in accordance with this FAQ remains subject to the general prohibitions of Rule 206(4)-1(a) (as well as section 206(1) and 206(2) of the Advisers Act)."

      "heading": "Portfolio or Investment Characteristics (March 19, 2025)",
      "faqs": [
        {
          "question": "The marketing rule does not define “performance” and, as a result, investment advisers may need to determine whether certain portfolio or investment characteristics (“characteristics”) are performance under the marketing rule. If such characteristics are performance, would the staff recommend enforcement action if an adviser displays characteristics calculated without reflecting the deduction of all fees and expenses that a client or investor has paid or would have paid in connection with the investment adviser's investment advisory services to the relevant portfolio(s) (“gross characteristics”), without also showing the corresponding characteristics calculated after the deduction of all fees and expenses (“net characteristics”)?",
          "answer": "The staff recognizes that advisers may be unsure whether certain characteristics (e.g., yield, coupon rate, contribution to return, volatility, sector or geographic returns, attribution analyses, the Sharpe ratio, the Sortino ratio, and other similar metrics)[8] are “performance” under the rule. In addition, even if such characteristics were to qualify as performance, calculating these characteristics net of fees and expenses may be impossible or lead to misleading or confusing results. However, in the staff’s view, when an adviser prominently displays the gross and net performance of the total portfolio calculated pursuant to the requirements of the marketing rule and presented in a manner that is not otherwise materially misleading, and provides appropriate accompanying information about the characteristic and how it is calculated, there is little risk that prospective clients and prospective investors will be misled about the impact of fees and expenses on their returns when viewing such a characteristic.\nAccordingly, the staff would not recommend enforcement action to the Commission under rule 206(4)-1(d)(1) if an adviser chooses to present in an advertisement one or more gross characteristics of a portfolio or investment, even if it does not include the corresponding net characteristic(s), if:\n the gross characteristic is clearly identified as being calculated without the deduction of fees and expenses;[9]\n the characteristic is accompanied by a presentation of the total portfolio’s gross and net performance consistent with the requirements of the rule;[10]\n the total portfolio’s gross and net performance is presented with at least equal prominence to, and in a manner designed to facilitate comparison with, the gross characteristic;[11] and\n the gross and net performance of the total portfolio is calculated over a period that includes the entire period over which the characteristic is calculated.\nBecause time periods over which characteristics are calculated may not easily align with the time periods required by Rule 206(4)-1(d)(2), the staff would not recommend enforcement action to the Commission under Rule 206(4)-1(d)(2) if the characteristic presented as described above is calculated over a single, clearly disclosed period.[12]\nThe staff notes that any advertisement that presents characteristics in accordance with this FAQ remains subject to the general prohibitions of Rule 206(4)-1(a) (as well as section 206(1) and 206(2) of the Advisers Act)."

      "heading": "Calculating Gross and Net Performance (February 6, 2024)",
      "faqs": [
        {
          "question": "Must gross and net performance shown in an advertisement always be calculated using the same methodology and over the same time period?",
          "answer": "Yes. Although the marketing rule does not prescribe any particular methodology or calculation for performance, the rule requires that any presentation of gross performance be accompanied by a presentation of net performance that has been calculated over the same time period and using the same type of return and methodology as the gross performance.[13] In addition, net performance must be presented in a format designed to facilitate comparison with gross performance.[14]\nThe staff understands that certain advisers to private funds may wish to present gross internal rate of return (“Gross IRR”) that is calculated from the time an investment is made (without reflecting fund borrowing or “subscription facilities”)[15] and then present net internal rate of return (“Net IRR”) that is calculated from the time investor capital has been called to repay such borrowing.[16] In the staff’s view, if an adviser chooses to exclude the impact of such subscription facilities from the fund’s Gross IRR, it cannot then include them in the Net IRR that is presented to comply with section (d)(1) of the marketing rule. In other words, when an adviser advertises its private fund’s performance in terms of Gross IRR and Net IRR, presenting Gross IRR that is calculated without the impact of fund-level subscription facilities compared only to Net IRR that is calculated with the impact of fund-level subscription facilities would violate the marketing rule. The staff believes that such a presentation would result in IRR calculations being made across different time periods (e.g., Gross IRR calculations beginning when funds initially use their lines of credit to acquire investments, and Net IRR calculations beginning only once all capital commitments are called and the lines of credit are retired).\nThis practice would also result in the use of different methodologies being used for the Gross and Net IRRs (i.e., calculating performance without and with the impact of fund-level subscription facilities). Such a presentation would also violate the provision requiring presentations of performance in a format designed to facilitate comparison between net and gross performance. [17] Accordingly, in the staff’s view, if an adviser were to include in an advertisement the Gross IRR of a private fund calculated from before capital commitments are called, then it would need also to show the Net IRR calculated from the same time before capital commitments are called (i.e., including the effect of fund-level subscription facilities in its calculation).\nFurther, in the staff’s view, an adviser would violate the general prohibitions (e.g., Rule 206(4)-1(a)(1) and Rule 206(4)-1(a)(6)) if it showed only Net IRR that includes the impact of fund-level subscription facilities without including either (i) comparable performance (e.g., Net IRR without the impact of fund-level subscription facilities) or (ii) appropriate disclosures describing the impact of such subscription facilities on the net performance shown. The staff believes that presenting only Net IRR that includes the impact of fund-level subscription facilities could mislead investors by suggesting that the fund’s advertised performance is similar to the performance that the investor has achieved from its investment in the fund alone."

The staff notes that performance extracted from a composite of portfolios may be considered hypothetical performance.",

    "3": "In the case of performance extracted from a representative account, the staff believes that the adviser could satisfy the positions stated herein if the gross performance of the extract was accompanied by the gross and net performance of a composite aggregation of all of the representative account’s related portfolios (rather than the gross and net performance of the total representative account from which the extract was extracted) presented in a manner consistent with positions stated herein.",
    "4": "The staff would view an advertisement as clearly identifying that the extracted performance is gross performance if, for example, it discloses that the extracted performance shown does not reflect the deduction of all fees and expenses that a client or investor has paid or would have paid and refers the recipient to the presentation of the total portfolio’s gross and net performance to understand the overall effect of fees.",
    "5": "Such accompanying presentation of gross and net performance of the total portfolio would be subject to the requirements relating to performance in Rule 206(4)-1(d).",
    "6": "In the staff’s view, the gross and net performance of the total portfolio does not need to be presented on the same page of the advertisement as the extracted performance, provided that the presentation facilitates comparison between the gross and net performance of the total portfolio and the extracted performance. For example, in the staff’s view, presenting the gross and net performance of the total portfolio prior to the extracted performance in the advertisement could also facilitate such comparisons and help ensure they are presented with at least equal prominence to the performance of the extract.",
    "7": "The staff notes, however, that in each case other than a private fund, Rule 206(4)-1(d)(2) requires that advertisements that include accompanying gross and net performance of the total portfolio present such performance over one-, five-, and ten-year periods, each presented with equal prominence and ending on a date that is no less recent than the most recent calendar year-end; except that if the relevant portfolio did not exist for a particular prescribed period, then the life of the portfolio must be substituted for that period.",

Whether a presentation of a characteristic in an advertisement is subject to Rule 206(4)-1(d) depends on whether such characteristic is performance. The staff in this FAQ is not taking a position on whether any particular characteristic or attribute should be considered “performance” for purposes of Rule 206(4)-1. To the extent a characteristic is not performance, the presentation of such characteristic would not be within the scope of Rule 206(4)-1(d).",
    "9": "The staff would view an advertisement as clearly identifying that the characteristic is calculated without the deduction of fees and expenses if, for example, it discloses that the characteristic shown does not reflect the deduction of all fees and expenses that a client or investor has paid or would have paid and refers the recipient to the presentation of the total portfolio’s gross and net performance to understand the overall effect of fees.",
    "10": "The view of the staff expressed in this FAQ also applies to characteristics calculated based on the performance of (i) a composite aggregation of related portfolios, (ii) a representative account; (iii) a subset of a portfolio (i.e., extracted performance), and (iv) a subset extracted from a composite aggregation of related portfolios, provided the characteristics are presented in a manner consistent with the FAQ. In the case of a characteristic calculated using a representative account, the staff believes that the adviser could satisfy the positions stated herein if the gross characteristic was accompanied by the gross and net performance of a composite aggregation of all of the representative account’s related portfolios (rather than the gross and net performance of the total representative account) in a manner consistent with the positions stated herein.\nSuch accompanying presentation of gross and net performance of the total portfolio would be subject to the requirements relating to performance in Rule 206(4)-1(d).",
    "11": "In the staff’s view, gross and net performance of the total portfolio does not need to be presented on the same page of the advertisement as the characteristic, provided that the presentation facilitates comparison between the gross and net performance of the total portfolio and the characteristic.

    "13": "Rule 206(4)-1(d)(1) prohibits an investment adviser from, directly or indirectly, disseminating any advertisement that includes “any presentation of gross performance, unless the advertisement also presents net performance: (i) with at least equal prominence to, and in a format designed to facilitate comparison with, the gross performance; and (ii) calculated over the same time period, and using the same type of return and methodology, as the gross performance.”",
