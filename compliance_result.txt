The phrases \"does guarantee future results\" and \"Yields will not vary\" directly contradict fundamental principles of investment risk and are prohibited under final rule 206(4)–1(a)(1), which prohibits untrue statements of a material fact, and final rule 206(4)–1(a)(7), which prohibits otherwise materially misleading advertisements. Investment performance and yields are inherently subject to market fluctuations and cannot be guaranteed.",
